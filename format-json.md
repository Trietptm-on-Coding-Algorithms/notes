# General
## Three ways to process structured data formats.
- **Iteration** - Iterating over Event (or, token) stream.
- **Data Binding** - Binding Json data into Objects (of your favorite language).
- **Tree Traversal** - Building a tree structure (from Json) and traversing it using suitable methods.

# XML
- SAX (iteration, push)
- STAX (iteration, pull)
- JAXB (data binding)
- DOM, XOM, JDOM, DOM4j (tree traversal)

# JSON
