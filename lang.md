*SICP section 2.2.4*
> "The language used at each level of stratified design has primitives, means of combination, and means of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail."

*Power Law Distributions in Class Relationships (Wheeldon & Counsell)*
> "A power law implies that small values are extremely common, whereas large values are extremely rare."
- log-log plot can show it for each specific case.

# Name Scoping
- lexical (static, block) scoping

# Concepts
- Application domains have conflicting needs.
- Programmer training is the dominant cost of a programming language (not R&D for it)
- Operator overloading (by default perl doesn't have operator overloading, so '>' is used for numbers and 'gt' is used for strings).
- Type casting / automatic type conversions
- Significant whitespace
    + yes (python)
    + no (java, javascript, perl, php)
- yada, yada operator (`...`) throws `Unimplemeted` exception (perl).
- Short-circuit evaluation
    + yes (java, perl)
