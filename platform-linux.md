## PCI
- `lspci | grep VGA` - find out graphics chip. Intel chips only need `xf86-video-intel` archlinux package.
- `lspci` - list all PCI hardware

## ACPI
- https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/power/states.txt

The kernel supports `freeze`(s0), `standby` (s1), `mem` (s3) and `disk`(s4) sleep states that can be read or written to the `/sys/power/state` file.  `disk` represents hibernation and the meaning of the remaining ones depends on the `relative_sleep_states` command line argument. For `disk`, a mechanism called `swsusp` (Swap Suspend) is used
to write memory contents to free swap space. Some, albeit outdated, documentation can be found in `Documentation/power/swsusp.txt`. Alternatively, userspace can do most of the actual suspend to disk work,
see `userland-swsusp.txt`.

- `cat /sys/power/state` - print supported power states.

# BIOS
- `lrmi` - Linux Real Mode Interface - http://sourceforge.net/projects/lrmi/ - library for calling real mode BIOS routines under Linux.
- `vbetool` - http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/vbetool.1.html - runs real-mode video BIOS code to alter hardware state. Uses `lrmi` in order to run code from the video BIOS. Currently, it is able to alter DPMS states, save/restore video card state and attempt to initialize the video card from scratch.

## VESA BIOS Extensions
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_BIOS_Extensions

Standard interface that can be used by software to access compliant video boards at high resolutions and bit depths. This is opposed to the "traditional" int 10h BIOS calls, which are limited to resolutions of 640x480 pixels with 16 color (4-bit) depth or less. VBE is made available through the video card's BIOS, which installs during boot up some interrupt vectors that point to itself.

### Swap Partition (type 82)
Used for swapping pages of memory between disk and RAM. Used for 'suspend-to-disk' power state.

Linux divides its physical RAM (random access memory) into chunks of memory called pages. Swapping is the process whereby a page of memory is copied to the preconfigured space on the hard disk, called swap space, to free up that page of memory. The combined sizes of the physical memory and the swap space is the amount of virtual memory available.

There is no performance advantage to either a contiguous swap file or a partition, both are treated the same way.
