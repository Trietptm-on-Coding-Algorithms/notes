Erlang, Haskell, Go, Rust are designed for concurrency.

# Multithreading

# How to measure multithreading efficiency?

- thread confinement
- shared state
- immutability
- thread local state
- synchronization
- lock
    - read lock
    - write lock
    - livelock
    - deadlock
    - promotable lock (from read to write)
    - shared lock vs mutex
- trap
- signal

## Patterns

### Single Producer / Multiple Consumer
- Blocking queues and poison pills
