# Misc
View model lives in the controller object.

# Data Binding (2-way)
Automatic synchronization of data between the **view** (DOM) and the **view model** in both directions.

# Templating
The HTML **template** is processed by the **compiler** during app load. Different **view models** are used to populate different part of the HTML **template**.
DOM is accessed **declaratively** through **directives**. 

# Form validation

# Ajax

# Event handling

# Reusable components

# Routing

# Deep linking

# Unit Testing

# End-to-end Testing

# Mocks

# Test Harnesses

# Filters
Specify what formatting to apply to an evaluated expression in the template.

# Design
The flow of marshaling data from the server to an internal object to an HTML form, allowing users to modify the form, validating the form, displaying validation errors, returning to an internal model, and then back to the server, creates a lot of boilerplate code.
