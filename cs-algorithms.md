# Tree

A tree is a DAG representing a hierarchy (nestedness).

- file systems
- XML/HTML
- AST

A tree may have an associated **node selection scheme**:
- file path, shell wildcard expansion, POSIX `find`
- XPath - http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/
- dot-notation
- URL/URI/URN
  + http
  + udp
  + git
  + ssh
  + ftp

Most of the node selection schemes deal with the following **concepts**:
- Absolute path
- Canonical path
- Relative path (context-sensitive)
- Wildcard expansion
- Pattern matching
